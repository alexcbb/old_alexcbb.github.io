            I'm a PhD student at `Ecole Centrale Lyon <https://www.ec-lyon.fr/>`_ supervised by `Liming Chen <https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VOPW5YYAAAAJ&hl=fr>`_ and `Emmanuel Dellandrea <https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=lK9Pa0MAAAAJ>`_. 
            I graduated from `Insa Rennes <https://www.insa-rennes.fr/>`_ in 2022 as a computer engineer and get a master degree in computer science research at `Universit√© de Rennes <https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/>`_.

Research
------------------------
Today, robots are mainly limited to accomplish *specific tasks* in already *known environments*. My goal is to develop an artificial intelligence that could permit to
easily generalize across tasks and environments. To do so, I'm currently studying **disentangled representation learning** to leverage its differents theoritical advantage
for robotics : data-efficiency, generalization, transferability or also interpretability.

My thesis will be splitted in the following components :

- **T1 - Disentangled latent representation of the observed environment**
- **T2 - Latent action space**
- **T3 - Dynamic-aware embeddings**
- **T4 - Transfer learning**
